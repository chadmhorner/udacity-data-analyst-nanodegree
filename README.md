Each folder in this repo is for a different project completed as part of the [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree].

[Project 2] is an analysis of 'old' stats vs. 'new' stats in Major League Baseball. Have new stats become a better predictor of postseason awards in recent years? Work for the project was done using **Python**.  
The prompt for the project was: _"Choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and Pandas. Go through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your findings."_  

[Project 3] cleans and examines OpenStreetMap data for New York City. In particular, I focused on trends in restaurants by neighborhood. The data is parsed and cleaned in *Python* and then read into and queried from a **SQL** database.  
The prompt for the project was: _"Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Choose to learn SQL or MongoDB and apply your chosen schema to the project."_  

[Project 4] is an examination of Federal Election Commission data from the past election cycle for the state of New Jersey. All work was done using **R**.   
The prompt for the project was: _"Use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies."_
